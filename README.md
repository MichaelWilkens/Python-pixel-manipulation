# Python-pixel-manipulation

This repo contains python image processing algorithms that loop through each pixel of a given photograph and perform one of two functions: 

1) objective_one.py takes an image and turns each of its 12 million pixels (1.2MP) into an rgba array [0,0,0], then rerenders the image
2) objective_two.py takes a black image and loops through the pixels, creating a matrix that renders into a double horizontal and            vertical strikethrough pattern.

Technologies used include OpenCV for image reading, numPy for matrix building and matplotlib for final rendering of the 3D matrix.
Built with python in VSCode.
